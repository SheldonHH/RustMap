# 1. Introducation
The purpose of this artifact is to reproduce the experimental results we achieved in the paper "RustMap: Towards Project-Scale C to Rust Migration via LLM."

We will demonstrate how to perform the Coverage Test, Complexity Test, Functionality Test of bzip2 and 125 Rosetta code, and the Unsafety Test.



## 1.1. version introduction
- [bzip2-1.0.8](https://gitlab.com/bzip2/bzip2/-/tree/bzip2-1.0.8?ref_type=tags)
- [rosetta code](https://rosettacode.org/)



#  2.  Scaffolding Boilerplate Generation (example of bzip2)

> The following operational instructions can be executed in the Docker image `rustmap-feasibility-study.tar.gz` available on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10433166). The operational code is present in both this repository and the Zenodo Docker image.
>

  
## 2.1. Step 0: Preparation for Scaffolding
copy c-code/bzip2 to scaffolding_test directory
```bash
cp -r c-code/bzip2 scaffolding_test/
```

## 2.2. Step 1: add save preprocessed file *.i during `make`   

```bash
cd scaffolding_test/bzip2
# replace Makefile with the one that can save temp files
cp -r Makefile-save-temps Makefile
```

### 2.2.1. Remove directives from *.i
 
```bash
for file in *.i; do awk '!/^#[ \t]*[0-9]+[ \t]+"/' "$file" > "${file}.tmp" && mv "${file}.tmp" "$file"; done

```

### 2.2.2.  Rename `bzip2recover.i` to `bzip2recover.i.bk`

Since we only focus on bzip2 executable binary, we need to exclude the bzip2recover.i
( Caveat: if the binary has more than one executable, we should exclude the unnecessary one )


   
## 2.3.  Dynamically applied Runtime Function Call Graph
As we write in paper, we try to run original C program and observe the calling relationship.


Add the -pg option to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS: This is used to enable Gprof profiling during compilation and linking.
We have added `-pg` flag to Makefile in `./bzip2-1.0.8/Makefile` this will help to generate 

1. in Makefile add -pg, this is used to enable Gprof profiling during compilation and linking.
```bash
CFLAGS=-Wall -Winline -O2 -g $(BIGFILES) -pg
LDFLAGS+= -pg
```
make sure the flag `-pg` in CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in `c-code/bzip2-1.0.8/Makefile`

2. Run the program to generate the `gmon.out` file
```bash
cd c-code/bzip2-1.0.8
make clean
make
./bzip2 -1 < sample1.ref > sample1.rb2
```

3. Generate the analysis report gprof.out using Gprof
```bash
gprof bzip2 gmon.out > gprof.out
```
4. Generate the Dynamic call graph `call_graph.png` using Gprof2Dot and dot:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gprof graphviz -y
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install gprof2dot 

gprof2dot -f prof gprof.out | dot -Tpng -o dynamic_call_graph.png

```

## 2.4. Generate Function Static Call Graph 


### 2.4.1. Use Static cflow

When using the cflow tool for a C project, it's generally recommended to have only one main function in the project. cflow is designed to analyze function call relationships in C programs and generates a call graph. If there are multiple main functions, cflow might face difficulties, as the main function typically serves as the entry point of a program. For projects with multiple main functions, like those containing independent sub-projects, you might need to run cflow separately for each part or adjust the project structure for effective analysis. In summary, having a single main function is the best practice for using cflow, unless you have specific needs and strategies to handle multiple instances. 
 
```bash
python3 cflow_generation.py /root/rustmap/bzip2-real-test
```


### 2.4.2. Step 4: Generate RustMap Scaffolding
```bash
python3 extract.py /root/rustmap/bzip2-real-test
```


# 3. Prompts
## 3.1. Prompt for directly applying LLM to translate
```bash

If the C code references other vital functions or structures, ask mefirst and wait for my provided input.(ASK ME first)Convert the given code to idiomatic Rust, keeping its function. Useminimal unsafe traits. Don't translate unknown variables or functions, and avoid assumptions.(ASK ME frst)

(1) If a variable inside the function is modified, add the mut specifier.
(2) Distinguish between mutable and immutable references by stor-ing intermediate values.
(3) If necessary, add lifetime annotations.
(4) Add clear comments for all numeric types and pay attention to type conversions, especially between usize and others.
(5) Be cautious of potential out-of-bound errors in the C code.
(6)Use the Rust standard library as much as possible.
(7)When performing arithmetic operations, be mindful of potentialoverflow or underflow.


(...Here is C Code to be translated...)


I must reiterate: if you encounter unfamiliar variables or functionsduring translation, you must ask me and wait for my provided inputbefore translating.(ASK ME FIRST)


```
## 3.2. Prompt to Resolve Compilation Error
Normally we will after our test generate compilation error, we will directly put the compilation error into ChatGPT-4
See the examples of compilation errors in the directory: `prompt_examples/compilation-errors` We have listed some of compilation from our RustMap Translation of Rosetta Code



## 3.3. Prompt to resolve Inconsistency error. 
 please generate Rust code fragment here to have
  consistent states as the C code above
```bash
// C code fragment with its before- and after-states:
{
    (before-state of C)
    (...Here is the C code fragment that have
        caused errors in the translated Rust...)
    (after-state of C)
}

// Rust code generation:
{
    (before-state in Rust)
    /** please generate Rust code fragment here to have
        consistent states as the C code above
      */
}
```
Please check the detailed Example in `./prompt_examples/inconsistency-solution`

# 9. Code Rewrite Pattern Samples

## 9.1. Global Variable Lazy Static
We have demonstrated the origianl C code and its Rust rewrite in the directory `code_patterns/global_variables_lazy_static`

## 9.2. Pointer Aliasing without Endiness Concern 
See the code under `/root/rustmap-clone/code_patterns/pointer_aliasing/raw_pointer_rewrite` to illustrate both pointer aliasing without endiness concern and with endiness concern


## 9.3. Pointer Aliasing with Endiness Concern 
See the code under `/root/rustmap-clone/code_patterns/pointer_aliasing/endianness_concern` to illustrate both pointer aliasing without endiness concern and with endiness concern
The Rust code above addresses the endianness concern in the C code. Here is a detailed explanation of how the C and Rust codes implement this functionality:

To view the code in details in the folder `/root/rustmap-clone/code_patterns/pointer_aliasing/endianness_concern`

### 9.3.1. C Code Implementation:

In the C code, data is manipulated directly using memory pointers. The specific steps are as follows:

1. **Define Structures and Types**:
    ```c
    typedef unsigned char UChar;
    typedef unsigned int UInt32;
    typedef int Int32;

    typedef struct {
        UChar* zbits;
        UInt32* arr2;
        Int32 nblock;
    } EState;
    ```

2. **Set Pointer**:
    ```c
    s.zbits = (UChar*) (&((UChar*)s.arr2)[s.nblock]);
    ```
    This line performs the following operations:
    - Casts `s.arr2` to a `UChar` type pointer.
    - Offsets this pointer by `s.nblock` and gets the address.
    - Assigns this address to `s.zbits`, making `s.zbits` point to the `nblock`th byte of `s.arr2`.

### 9.3.2. Rust Code Implementation:

The Rust code implements the same logic as the C code but in a safer manner by handling memory and endianness explicitly:

1. **Define Structure and Function**:
    ```rust
    pub struct EState { 
        pub zbits: Vec<u8>,
        pub arr2: Vec<u32>,
        pub nblock: i32,
    }

    fn get_zbits(estate: &mut EState) {
        let nblock = estate.nblock as usize;
        let offset = nblock / 4;
        let remaining_bytes = estate.arr2.len() * 4 - nblock;
        estate.zbits.clear();
        estate.zbits.reserve(remaining_bytes);

        for &num in &estate.arr2[offset..] {
            let bytes = if cfg!(target_endian = "little") {
                num.to_le_bytes()
            } else {
                num.to_be_bytes()
            };

            let start_index = if estate.zbits.is_empty() { nblock % 4 } else { 0 };
            estate.zbits.extend_from_slice(&bytes[start_index..]);
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Handle Endianness and Update Array**:
    ```rust
    fn update_block_from_zbits(estate: &mut EState) {
        /* ... */
    }
    ```

### 9.3.3. Summary of Differences:

- **C Code**: Directly manipulates memory pointers and offsets, a low-level approach prone to errors but often used in hardware control or high-performance needs.
- **Rust Code**: Uses safe methods to handle memory and endianness, ensuring correct operation across different endianness systems and avoiding memory safety issues.

The comparison highlights that Rust code is more robust in handling memory safety and cross-platform compatibility.

## 9.4. Illustrate Necessity to rewrite Complex Macro and how to rewrite C `switch-case` to Rust `while match`
In this folder, you can see that the `.c` switch case has a fall-through state. The corresponding `c2rust-decompress.rs` uses complex match blocks to handle this fall-through, while our `rustmap-decompress.rs` uses a relatively simple and clear `while-loop` to handle it.

You can clearly see the code explosion in `decompress.i` and `c2rust-decompress.rs`, so finding the correct way to rewrite it is extremely important.

See the code under `/root/rustmap/code_patterns/complex_switch_fall_through_complex_macros` to illustrate
