If the C code references other vital functions or structures, ask me first and wait for my provided input. (ASK ME first) Convert the given code to idiomatic Rust, keeping its func- tion. Use minimal unsafe traits. Donâ€™t translate unknown vari-
ables or functions, and avoid assumptions. (ASK ME first)
(1) If a variable inside the function is modified, add the mut specifier.

(2) Distinguish between mutable and immutable refer- ences by storing intermediate values.
(3) Ifnecessary,addlifetimeannotations.needaddmore refe
(4) Add clear comments for all numeric types and pay at- tention to type conversions, especially between usize and others.
(5) Be especially careful if the C code itself has out-of- bound errors.
(6) UsetheRustlibraryasmuchaspossible.
(7) When performing arithmetic operations, be mindful
of potential overflow or underflow.

I must reiterate: if you encounter unfamiliar variables or functions during translation, you must ask me and wait for my provided input before translating.
