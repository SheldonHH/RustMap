/*                    ** Chapter I - Introduction **
 *
 *  You are Trimul. You've always wanted to do fast matrix multiplication, but they said
 *  "Don't bother, big dumb Cublas is much faster than you!"
 *  "I don't need to be faster than Cublas", you replied, "I can be smarter. Cublas calculates
 *  the entire matrix, but I need only half. If I'm more than half as fast as Cublas, I'm
 *  going to win."
 *
 *  So to prove everyone wrong, you enter the TriMatlon, the most prestigious competition
 *  for anyone paying Attention.
 *
 *  Before you start preparing, lets have a look at the players involved
 *
 *  First, there is the Referee (`trimul_cpu`), slow and ponderous, but producing results
 *  beyond reproof.
 *  Then, there is Cublas. Cublas' mind is so inflexible, it doesn't actually comprehend
 *  what we are trying to do here, so Cublas has brought an assistant (`permute_kernel`)
 *  that translates the competition into a task that it can solve. But once it recognizes
 *  the problem, its muscle memory kicks in, and matrix products are produced faster than
 *  the eye can see. Stuck in its routine, Cublas doesn't realize the task is already
 *  finished with the lower triangle, though.
 *
 *  If you can do without an assistant, and can solve the right task, then that's your opportunity
 *  to shine!

/*                    ** Chapter II - Getting a Team **
 *
 *  OK, you've registered for the competition, now what to do. TriMatlon is a team competition, so first, you need
 *  to figure out what kind of team you need, and how to organize it. The individual instances and heads of the
 *  problem are completely independent, so you just can send separate teams to work there completely independently.
 *
 *  To figure out how to organize each team, you take out your spyglass (`Nsight Compute`) and look how the Cublas teams
 *  are handling their work.
 *  Turns out, you need 256 athletes in each group, and those handle 128 x 128 of the tasks. They work together in
 *  a tight square formation, 16 wide and 16 deep.
 *
 *  So, you went out and got your 100 000 friends, and split them into groups (`trimul_launcher`). Each group gets
 *  informed about where they should work (`trimul_global`) and goes off to do their thing (`matmul_tri_naive`).
 *  Let's observe how we're doing.

 *  You go over to the playing field. On one end of the field, there is a huge pile of funnily shaped cookie cutters.
 *  Some in the shape of animals, some in the shape of a landscape. Each group of workers has assigned some runners,
 *  fetching the cookie cutters for them. The workers seem very relaxing, chatting with each other, lounging about.
 *  You focus in on one of them.
 *
 *  He seems to be giving an instruction to a runner, and then turns back to reading a novel. The runner, meanwhile,
 *  crosses the field and back, handing him an elephant shape. Then she's off again to pick up a savannah background.
 *  Having received the two shapes, pressed them into the dough, and makes an elephant-in-the-savannah cookie. He hands
 *  the cutters back to the runner. "Can you please fetch me an elephant and a jungle next?"
 *  While she's on her way, he takes a sip off his cocktail.
 *  This time, she's making only one trip, keeping the elephant in her pocket (_Cache_). Still, it seems to take forever.
 *  You keep observing:
 *  - Elephant and zoo
 *  - Elephant and island
 *  ...
 *  - Lion and savannah
 *  - Lion and jungle
 *  - Lion and zoo
 *  ...
 *
 *  The worker has his poor runner fetch the same things over and over again, looking like she's about to faint from exhaustion.
 *  Even though she realizes this and always keeps one of them in her pocket, there is so much running,
 *  and little actual work happening.
 *
 *  Clearly, this isn't going to be effective, so you call a team meeting.

 *  Each worker is producing 64 combined cookies from 8 animals and 8 landscapes. They send there runners of 64 times
 *  to fetch the corresponding shapes. This is terribly inefficient; The runners need a minute or so for each trip,
 *  but making a cookie can be done in just a second.
 *
 *  "Let's try something different tomorrow: Just get all 16 cookie cutters that you need, and do all 64 combinations
 *  of them! See all this free space on your workbench (_registers_), you can keep them all there for easy access."
 *
 *  The next morning, you come back to the field for another practice session. Initially, there is bustling activity
 *  with the runners, picking up 16 shapes for each worker. But then, the workers have to put down their newspapers
 *  and start making cookies. Now there are 64 combinations, so it takes them a full minute.
 *
 *  Not all groups of workers are equally fast. When the first group finishes with all animal-landscape combinations,
 *  they already start asking the runners for the next set of cookie cutters, combining plants and houses. Even though
 *  the workers are much busier than before, they are still spending most of their time just waiting.
 *
 *  Still, instead of being busy for 20 hours, your team is now done with the task in just 3h 30 minutes; already, this
 *  is five times faster.
 *
 *  You think to yourself: "Why should we stop at 8 x 8 combinations? Lets to 16 x 16, that's only twice the work for
 *  the runners, but four times as much for the actual workers."
 *  You head over to the baking area, and make that suggestion to one of your team leaders.
 *  "In theory, that sounds great", she agrees, "but see, we only have limited space on our workbenches (_registers_).
 *  There is still some room left, but we simply cannot bake 256 cookies at the same time, sorry."
 *

 *  "But the lion is right next to the palm tree. You could bring those two together?", you confirm.

 *  so much easier. See, I have this bucket, I could carry lots of things in one go if I could just scoop them up
 *  from the same place (_coalesced access_).
 *
 *  OK, then lets fetch the first animal, first plant, first vehicle, and first landmark shape in one go (_vectorized load_).
 *  [Here, the metaphor breaks down a bit: Since we're accumulating all the results, getting more data at the same time
 *  depth-wise doesn't require more space on the workbench. We're stacking the cookies!]
 *
 *  You also streamline the shape combination further. Instead of picking up all animals and landscapes at one, it is
 *  more efficient, using less workbench space, to just pick up all animals. Then, you get one landscape, combine it
 *  will all animals, get the next landscape, combine, and so on.
 *
 *  In this way, instead of 2 x 8 x 4 cookie cutters that take up space, you only need (8+1) x 4 at the same time.

 *
 *  In the arena, each team also has access to a small storage hut, much closer to their workbenches than the piles of
